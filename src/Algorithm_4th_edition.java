/**
 * An abstract data type is a data type whose representation is hidden from the client,Implementing an ADT as a Java
 * class is not very different from implementing a function library as a set of static methods.the primary difference
 * is that we associate data with the function implementation and we hide the representation of the data from the client.
 * When using an ADT,we focus on the operations specified in the API and pay no attention to the data representation;
 * when implementing and ADT,we focus on the data,then implement operations on that data.
