/**
 * ArrayDeque is resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface.Array deques have no capacity
 * restrictions;they grow as necessary to support usage.they are not thread-safe.NULL elements are
 * prohibited.This class is likely to be faster than Stack when used as a stack,and faster than
 * LinkedList when used as a queue.
 *
 *      Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
 *
 * Among ArrayList,LinkedList and ArrayDeque.ArrayDeque is the best.it doesn't have the overhead of node
 * allocation that LinkedList dose nor the overhead of shifting the array contents left on remove that
 * ArrayLst has.
